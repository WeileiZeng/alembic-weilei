As I am supposed to read papers endlessly, here is a finite list of the papers I am reading, with a brief summary. I also use SciRate for collecting papers.

* [Correcting coherent errors with surface codes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-018-0106-y)

So far the error models I use, either depolarizing channels or circuit error models, with or without measurement error, are stochastic models which assume almost all qubits are independent. In realistic situations, there are also coherent error. For example, a misalignment of the pulse frequency will result in small rotation errors everywhere.
